The main objective of SAR Team is to find victims as soon as possible after natural disasters happen. Research on a robot that helps teams find victims growing rapidly. Unfortunately, previous studies have only tested a toll on the detection process simple background such as indoors or in the field. Though detection of victims of natural disasters has a difficulty level of the complex, where the image of the human condition resembles the image of post-disaster environment. At the end of this project will do research on the detection of victims of natural disasters with image data taken from the air. To improve detection accuracy, Deep Learning will be implemented together with the framework Caffe on image processing architecture using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Deep Learning is able to perform feature extraction in the learning process so that researchers do not need to define a feature that will be used. This research will also make a special dataset victims of natural disasters that represent the real situation. On the output is expected to find survivors of victims and pinpoint the areas most heavily. With the air search that automatically finds the location of the victim, then SAR Team can go directly to the location with minimal safety risks and inefficiencies of time.

The results for progress of this final project are we were able to know the ability of taking and sending pictures and try to run learning and testing algorithm on different images. Tests performed by four images resolution to look the data size, timing and accuracy. Data capture images with a resolution of 800x600 is considered the most optimal because it has a relatively small data size, the detection time is short but with a relatively high detection accuracy. Furthermore, the dataset will be made to do a re-training, testing with different poses victim and testing on a single map intact made while browsing the air.
